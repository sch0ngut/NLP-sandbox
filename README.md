# NLP-sandbox

This repository contains some code examples that I wrote while following a Udemy course on [Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning in Python].

[Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning in Python]: https://www.udemy.com/course/natural-language-processing-with-deep-learning-in-python/ 

Note: Some of the codes involve pretrained word embeddings (GloVe or Word2wec). They can be downloaded from:
- GloVe: http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip
- Word2vec: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7XkCwpI5KDYNlNUTTlSS21pQmM/edit?usp=sharing
